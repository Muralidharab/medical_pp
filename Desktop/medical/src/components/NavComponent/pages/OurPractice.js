        Doctor Who is a British science fiction television series broadcast by
        the BBC since 1963. The series, created by Sydney Newman, C. E. Webber
        and Donald Wilson, depicts the adventures of an extraterrestrial being
        called the Doctor, part of a humanoid species called Time Lords. The
        Doctor travels in the universe and in time using a time travelling
        spaceship called the TARDIS, which externally appears as a British
        police box. While travelling, the Doctor works to save lives and
        liberate oppressed peoples by combating foes. The Doctor often travels
        with companions. Beginning with William Hartnell, fourteen actors have
        headlined the series as the Doctor; as of 2024, Ncuti Gatwa leads the
        series as the Fifteenth Doctor. The transition from one actor to another
        is written into the plot of the series with the concept of regeneration
        into a new incarnation, a plot device in which, when a Time Lord is
        fatally injured, their cells regenerate and they are reincarnated. Each
        actor's portrayal is distinct, but all represent stages in the life of
        the same character and, together, they form a single lifetime with a
        single narrative. The time-travelling nature of the plot means that
        different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. In 2017, Jodie
        Whittaker, as the Thirteenth Doctor, became the first woman to be cast
        in the lead role. The s Premise Doctor Who follows the adventures of the
        title character, a rogue Time Lord with somewhat unknown origins who
        goes by the name "the Doctor". The Doctor fled Gallifrey, the planet of
        the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS ("Time and Relative Dimension(s) in
        Space"), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and
        dematerialising out of, the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior
        but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a "chameleon
        circuit" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of loc
